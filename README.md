# Bug Tracking App
 This is a Bug tracking App where a group of developers or a company can record their bugs on a system where they can keep track of the type of bugs and how critical the bugs are. The application is a crud system where users can log in as an admin or user, they can create bug to display to all the developers or have private bugs that they need to fix themselfs. The user can filter and sort bugs to thier liking as well as add comments under bugs.

## Lessons learned
In this project I learnt alot about backend and node js as well as some authentication using JWT and cookies. This project gave me a good idea of how to use node.js as well as many packages to help route or add midlleware for protection. This have given me an interest to learn more about backend development to help me understand the best practises to develope my front end to make it clear for the back end developer to connect their code to mine. With this project I used a bit of bootstrap as a struture but most of the CSS is showed me how much goes into writing custom css and how much time can be saved when designing for all screen resolutions.

## Potential future features
I hope to be able to upload images for bugs to help the users to understand the problem of a bug. 
User's can comment on other users bugs to ask questions, supply ideas or explain bug.  
I also want to add more authentication as I learn more about back end where the user can reset password without admin.  
Password reset using emails.
